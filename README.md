# ReadMe!

This is a prototype for an app I want to build that will host various games and projects that develop.

Future steps:

Documentation:

Consider using tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from docstrings in your code. Good documentation is essential for making your project easy to understand and use.

Continuous Integration (CI):

Set up a CI system to automatically run tests and checks whenever you push changes to your repository. This helps catch errors early and ensures that your code remains in a working state.

Code Style:

Define and adhere to a consistent code style guide, such as PEP 8 for Python. Tools like flake8 or pylint can help enforce these style guidelines.

Dependency Management:

Maintain a requirements.txt file listing all the dependencies required for your project. This makes it easy for others to install the necessary dependencies.


### Other notes:

Game Initialization:

When the game starts (e.g., when game.py is executed), it initializes the game board, sets up the player turns, and determines the game mode (e.g., singleplayer, multiplayer, AI vs. AI).
AI Integration:

If the selected game mode involves AI (e.g., singleplayer against AI, AI vs. AI), the game logic in game.py can interact with the AI functionality defined in ai_model.py.
For example, in a singleplayer game against AI, after the player makes a move, the game logic can call the AI function to determine the AI's move.
Turn-based Gameplay:

The game proceeds in a turn-based manner, where players (or AI) take turns making moves until the game reaches a win, draw, or lose condition.
AI Decision-making:

When it's the AI's turn to move, the game logic invokes the appropriate AI function/method defined in ai_model.py.
The AI function/method computes the optimal move based on the current game state and returns the chosen move to the game logic.
Game Outcome:

The game logic evaluates the moves made by players (or AI) to determine if there's a win, draw, or ongoing game.
If the game ends (e.g., win or draw condition is met), the game logic updates the game state accordingly and displays the outcome to the players.
