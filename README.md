# ReadMe!

This is a prototype for an app I want to build that will host various games and projects that develop.

Future steps:

Documentation:

Consider using tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from docstrings in your code. Good documentation is essential for making your project easy to understand and use.

Continuous Integration (CI):

Set up a CI system to automatically run tests and checks whenever you push changes to your repository. This helps catch errors early and ensures that your code remains in a working state.

Code Style:

Define and adhere to a consistent code style guide, such as PEP 8 for Python. Tools like flake8 or pylint can help enforce these style guidelines.

Dependency Management:

Maintain a requirements.txt file listing all the dependencies required for your project. This makes it easy for others to install the necessary dependencies.
